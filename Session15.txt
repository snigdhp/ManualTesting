Error Guessing Technique
-------------------------

Error guessing is a software testing technique in which the tester uses  their experience of prior testing & intuition to guess the types of errors that might occur in a system, and then tests for those specific errors.


It is not a replacement for formal testing methods and should not be relied upon as the sole testing approach.

The error guessing is best used to supplement other testing techniques and methods to identify defects that may have been missed by other approaches. 



Example
---------
Suppose a tester is testing a web application that allows users to create and manage accounts. 
The tester might use error guessing to identify potential errors that could occur during the account creation process.

Based on their experience with similar systems, the tester might guess that the following errors could occur:

Invalid email address format:
------------------------------
The system may not properly validate email addresses, allowing users to enter invalid formats that could cause problems later on.
Enter an invalid email address format (e.g., missing the “@” symbol) and attempt to create an account. Verify that the system displays an error message and does not allow the account to be created.

Password too weak-
----------------------
The system may not enforce password complexity requirements, allowing users to create weak passwords that could easily guessed or hacked.

Create an account with a weak password (e.g., “password” or “123456”). Verify that the system displays an error message and does not allow the account create.

Duplicate usernames-
-------------------------
The system may not properly check for duplicate usernames, allowing users to create multiple accounts with the same username.

Attempt to create multiple accounts with the same username. Verify that the system displays an error message and does not allow the duplicate account create.


User profile not properly saved-
--------------------------------
The system may not properly save user profile information, causing user data lost or corrupted. 

Create a user profile and verify that the information properly saved and can access later.
