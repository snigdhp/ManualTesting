Sample Defect Report Template
----------------------------------
1) Defect ID: Unique No or Name

2) Description: Summary of the defect

3) Feature: Module / Function / Service, in these module TE found the defect

4) Test Case Name: Corresponding failing test condition

5) Reproducible (Yes / No): Yes -> Every time defect appears during test execution
No -> Rarely defect appears

6) If Yes, attach the test procedure:

7) If No, attach snapshot & strong reasons:
  
8) Status: New / Reopen

9) Severity: Seriousness of defect w.r.t functionality (high / medium / low)

13) Assign to: Name of the responsible person in development team -> PM

14) Build Version ID: In which build, Test Engineer fount the defect

15) Suggested fix (Optional): Tester tries to produce a suggestion to solve this defect

16) Fixed by: PM or Team Lead

17) Resolved by: Developer name

18) Resolved on: Date of solving By Developers
