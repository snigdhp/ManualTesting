Adhoc Testing
-------------
It is a informal testing process. It is performed after formal testing.
There is no documentation.
There is no test design
There is not test cases.
There is not requirement spec.
Mostly negative test scenarios are tested with a aim to break the system.
In this we check application without any sequence or procedure randomly and find some issues.
The effectiveness of adhoc testing depends upon the capability of the tester and tester in depth knowledge about the system.
It helps to simulate unusual behavior and hard-find and hard to reproduce bugs/defects.

Exploratory Testing
-------------------
 In this testing, first application under test is explored, flow of application is understood , then test case is designed and test cases are executed. 
This testing is performed when requirement is missing.
This is also informal testing process.
It involves test design and control and notes are taken
progress is also tracked.
It helps to study the product and agument the document and also research the bug.

Monkey Testing
--------------
This test is also random in nature, therefore test cases are not used in monkey testing.
Monkey testing can be performed by an individual who does not have a good knowledge of the application.
Tester test randomly by clicking on random objects and entering the random and invalid data to check is the application give an error or not.
